<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
## Concept Process

The concept was obviously largely around whatsapp, that formed a large part of the ideation for me and helped me gauge where i wanted certain features to be and where i wanted everythign to be lined up

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* Made use of Hilt for dependency injection for Firebase and database calls.
* Firebase for backend control and storage of data and images


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* The biggest highlight was getting the chat features working.
* Getting the chat working meant i had the main features under control and could go from there, it was the core of the app so it made me the most <br/>
when i got it working!

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* The biggest bug was with Firebase and android studio, i found it a little difficult regarding connection and working with the database 
* The Android Emulator has always been the biggest struggle for me, it slows down my laptop astronomically, luckily i was able to use a friends mac whcich solved the issue

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

* I started off using the old xml files becuase they made more sense to me but after spending some time with Jetpack compose it proved to be so much simpler than i expected
  
## Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In the future i would like to add the ability to send images 
* Create statuses and be able to comment on them
