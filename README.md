<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][image1]

### Project Description

This project was developed as a way for users to track and manage calories and steps in order to get them on the right track in their fitness journey. 

### Built With

* [Xcode](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
* [HealthKit](https://firebase.google.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

### Feature 1
![image2][image2]
- Tracking total calories after permission has been given for the app to access the users private and specific health data

### Feature 2
![image3][image3]
- Launch screen

### Feature 3
![image4][image4]
- Utilising Apple's CoreData, users can track and managed their calories for the day through the use of an intuitive UI

![image5][image5]


<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
## Concept Process

Developing the wireframes and figuring out how i wanted the user to navigate the app, authentication, dashboard views and detailed views
with the respected data sets

![image9][image9]


<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* Wireframing and concept ideastion
* Developing the user flow, Implementing UI such as onboarding screens, splash screens and views for the app
* Core data and calorie count
* Fetching and displaying steps by way of graphs

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Fetching and displaying steps and calories was my bigges highlight, it took me so long to work it out so when it finally came together it was such a relief
#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* The biggest challenge was fetching data from the phone, i spent a lot of time trying to use my physical device as a emulator when i could of simply used the health app built into the phone within the simulator to create the data.
* Another big challenge was working with screens and displaying them with or without the correct authentication which i achieved through FaceID.
* Creating and displaying the launch screen correctly proved to be very tedious as there were a lot of moving parts with regards to view protection. Implemented using storyboard

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

* I got some very positive feedback from users regarding the core data and calorie tracking implementation
  
## Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In the future i would love to have an option where users can share there progress with others within the app and create a community
* Improve and clean UI
* Create more tracking with larger sets of data
